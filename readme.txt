Google Charts - 

I used an npm package - 'react-google-charts' that provides react components for the google charts library.

I used the line chart to show the metrics. I could have used the Calendar chart to show github like metrics but
that would not have been able to show the difference between the three time periods as it would have been the 
same chart.
